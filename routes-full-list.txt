# Full list of routes from your data
# WARNING: This is a HUGE list (1300+ routes) and may overload your router
# It's better to use aggregated CIDR blocks instead

# Format for Keenetic CLI:
# ip route <network/mask> <interface>

# Example of how to apply these routes:
# 1. Connect via SSH: ssh admin@router_ip
# 2. Enter configuration mode: configure
# 3. Add routes one by one: ip route 1.9.57.0/24 Wireguard0
# 4. Save: system configuration save
# 5. Exit: exit

# RECOMMENDATION: Instead of adding 1300+ individual /24 routes,
# use the aggregated script (apply-routes.sh) which uses larger CIDR blocks
# This will be much more efficient and won't overload the router

# Your original routes (converted to correct syntax):
ip route 1.9.57.0/24 Wireguard0
ip route 1.9.91.0/24 Wireguard0
ip route 1.37.40.0/24 Wireguard0
ip route 1.37.41.0/24 Wireguard0
ip route 1.37.42.0/24 Wireguard0
# ... (and 1300+ more routes)

# NOTE: This file is for reference only
# Use apply-routes.sh for actual deployment
